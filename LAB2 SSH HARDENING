## Initial Baseline (Before Hardening)

- SSH running on default port 22 
- Password authentication enabled
- Root login potentially allowed
- No firewall restrictions
- No brute-force protection

---

## Hardening Measures Implemented

### 1. SSH Configuration Hardening

- Changed default SSH port (22 → 2222)
- Disabled root login
- Disabled password authentication
- Enabled key-based authentication only
- Limited authentication attempts (MaxAuthTries = 3)
- Restricted allowed users

### 2. SSH Key-Based Authentication

- Generated ED25519 key pair
- Deployed public key to authorized_keys
- Disabled password-based access

### 3. Firewall Configuration (UFW)

- Default deny incoming
- Default allow outgoing
- Explicitly allowed port 2222 only

### 4. Fail2Ban Deployment

- Enabled SSH jail
- Configured maxretry = 3
- Configured bantime = 3600 seconds
- Integrated with UFW for automated blocking

## Validation & Testing

### Test 1 – Successful SSH Key Login
Result: Access granted without password.

### Test 2 – Password Authentication Attempt
Result: Access denied.

### Test 3 – Brute-Force Simulation (3+ failures)
Result: Attacker IP automatically banned by Fail2Ban.

### Test 4 – Firewall Inspection
Result: Only port 2222 exposed.

## Security Improvements Achieved

| Control | Risk Mitigated |
|----------|---------------|
| Disable root login | Privileged brute-force |
| Non-default SSH port | Automated scanning noise |
| Key-based authentication | Credential brute-force |
| Fail2Ban | Automated incident response |
| UFW restrictions | Attack surface reduction |

## CIS Benchmark Alignment (Selected Controls)

- Enforced SSH protocol version 2
- Disabled password authentication
- Restricted user access
- Reduced open network services
- Enforced strong authentication mechanisms

Reference: CIS Ubuntu Linux Benchmark

## Lessons Learned

- Network segmentation is critical in lab design.
- Systemd socket activation can override SSH port changes.
- Log monitoring is essential for validating defensive controls.
- Testing is mandatory after every configuration change.
